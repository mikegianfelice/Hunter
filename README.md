```bash
pip uninstall solana -y
pip install solana==0.27.0
```

### 3. Configure the Bot

#### 🔐 Secure Secrets Management

The bot supports multiple secure secrets backends to protect your wallet credentials. **For most users, we recommend using the `.env` file approach (Option C) as it's simpler and doesn't require AWS setup.**

**Option A: AWS Secrets Manager (Production)**
```bash
# Install AWS CLI and configure credentials
aws configure

# Run interactive setup
python setup_secrets.py
```

**Option B: Environment Variables**
```bash
# Set environment variables
export TRADING_BOT_SECRETS_PRIVATE_KEY="your_ethereum_private_key"
export TRADING_BOT_SECRETS_WALLET_ADDRESS="your_ethereum_wallet_address"
export TRADING_BOT_SECRETS_SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY="your_solana_private_key"
export TRADING_BOT_SECRETS_SOLANA_WALLET_ADDRESS="your_solana_wallet_address"
export TRADING_BOT_SECRETS_INFURA_URL="https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/your_key"
export TRADING_BOT_SECRETS_BASE_RPC_URL="https://mainnet.base.org"
export TRADING_BOT_SECRETS_SOLANA_RPC_URL="https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com"
export TRADING_BOT_SECRETS_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="your_telegram_bot_token"
export TRADING_BOT_SECRETS_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID="your_chat_id"
```

**Option C: .env File (Recommended for most users)**
```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env file with your credentials
nano .env
```

**Configure Secrets Backend**
Add this line to your `.env` file to avoid AWS errors:
```env
SECRETS_BACKEND=env
```

#### 🔄 Migrate from .env (Legacy)

If you have an existing `.env` file, migrate to secure storage:
```bash
python setup_secrets.py migrate
```

#### 📝 .env Configuration (Recommended)

Create your `.env` file with the following structure:

```env
# Ethereum/Base Wallet Configuration (MetaMask)
PRIVATE_KEY=your_ethereum_private_key_here
WALLET_ADDRESS=your_ethereum_wallet_address_here

# Solana Wallet Configuration (Phantom)
SOLANA_WALLET_ADDRESS=your_phantom_wallet_address_here
SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY=your_phantom_private_key_here

# Blockchain RPC URLs
INFURA_URL=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/your_infura_key
BASE_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org
SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com

# Telegram Configuration (Optional)
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_chat_id

# Secrets Backend Configuration (Important!)
SECRETS_BACKEND=env
```

**⚠️ Security Note**: Keep your `.env` file secure and never commit it to version control. The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits.

```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Insufficient funds"**
   - Ensure your wallet has enough native tokens for gas fees
   - Check your private key is correct
   - Verify RPC endpoints are accessible
   - The bot now automatically checks wallet balance before trading
   - Consider reducing trade amount if balance is low

2. **"SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY not found"**
   - Ensure Solana private key is set in .env file
   - Check key format (should be base58 encoded)
   - Verify SOLANA_RPC_URL is accessible
   - For production trading, use a paid RPC provider

3. **"No Raydium pool found"**
   - Token may not have liquidity on Raydium
   - Check if token is listed on Raydium
   - Verify token mint address is correct
   - Some tokens may only be available on other DEXs

2. **"Transaction failed"**
   - Increase gas limit in config.yaml
   - Check network congestion
   - Verify token contract is valid
   - Ensure sufficient native tokens for gas

3. **"No trending tokens found"**
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify API endpoints are accessible
   - Adjust trending thresholds
   - Check if tokens are being filtered as promotional

4. **"Chain not supported"**
   - Verify chain is in supported_chains list
   - Check chain configuration in multi_chain_executor.py
   - Ensure RPC URL is correct

5. **"Token already held"**
   - The bot prevents buying the same token multiple times
   - This is a safety feature to avoid concentration risk
   - Wait for the position to close before buying again

6. **"Insufficient balance"**
   - The bot checks wallet balance before trading
   - Includes gas fee buffer to prevent failed transactions
   - Consider reducing trade amount or adding more funds

7. **"Token delisted"**
   - The bot automatically detects delisted tokens
   - Sends Telegram alert with loss amount
   - Removes from active monitoring
   - Logs as "delisted" trade with 100% loss

8. **"Price fetch failed"**
   - Check RPC endpoint connectivity
   - Verify token address is correct
   - May indicate token is delisted or has no liquidity
   - Bot will automatically handle after 5 consecutive failures

9. **"Network error checking Jupiter tradeability: ConnectionError"**
   - **UPDATED in v2.7**: Jupiter API endpoints have changed
   - Old endpoint `quote-api.jup.ag` no longer exists (DNS fails)
   - New endpoint `api.jup.ag` requires API authentication (returns 401)
   - **Impact**: Minimal - bot continues trading with graceful degradation
   - Tradeability pre-checks are skipped; actual swap attempts determine if tokens are tradeable
   - This is NOT an internet connection issue - it's a Jupiter API infrastructure change

10. **"Bot running for 10+ hours with no trades"**
    - **FIXED**: This critical issue has been resolved in v2.9
    - The pre-buy delisting check was incorrectly blocking ALL new tokens due to SOL price API failures
    - Solana tokens were being marked as "delisted" because Jupiter API calls were failing
    - The strategy now trusts DexScreener data for Solana tokens with good volume/liquidity
    - Update to the latest version to fix this issue
    - The bot now properly distinguishes between delisted tokens and new tokens

11. **"All Solana tokens marked as delisted"**
    - **FIXED**: This issue has been resolved in v2.9
    - Jupiter API parameter errors were causing all price validation to fail
    - CoinGecko rate limiting was preventing SOL price fetching
    - The bot now uses volume/liquidity thresholds for Solana token evaluation
    - Update to the latest version to fix this issue

12. **"Jupiter quote failed (attempt 1/3): 400"**
    - **FIXED**: This issue has been resolved in v3.6
    - **Causes**: Invalid token addresses, insufficient liquidity, API parameter validation issues
    - **Solution**: Bot now uses direct routes and legacy transactions to reduce transaction size
    - **Result**: Successfully executing trades with known tradeable tokens (BONK, PEPE, JITO)
    - **Status**: ✅ Resolved with transaction size optimization

13. **"base64 encoded solana_transaction::versioned::VersionedTransaction too large"**
    - **FIXED**: This issue has been resolved in v3.6
    - **Causes**: Complex Jupiter routes creating transactions larger than Solana's 1644-byte limit
    - **Solution**: Bot now uses direct routes and legacy transactions to reduce size
    - **Result**: Successfully executing trades with optimized transaction size
    - **Status**: ✅ Resolved with route optimization

14. **"Could not get SOL price from any source"**
    - **CURRENT ISSUE**: All SOL price APIs (CoinGecko, Jupiter, DexScreener) are failing
    - **Causes**: Rate limiting, API downtime, network connectivity issues
    - **Workaround**: Bot uses fallback price when all sources fail
    - **Solution**: Enhanced fallback mechanisms and alternative price sources
    - **Status**: Being improved with better error handling

15. **"Configuration not reloading"**
    - **FIXED**: This issue has been resolved in v3.2
    - **Cause**: Python modules were loading config at import time and caching values
    - **Solution**: Implemented dynamic configuration loading with `config_loader.py`
    - **Result**: Changes to `config.yaml` now take effect immediately without restart
    - **Status**: ✅ Resolved with automatic cache clearing

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging in `config.yaml`:
```yaml
debug_mode: true
log_level: DEBUG
```

- **Position Limits**: Maximum concurrent positions
- **Trade Size Limits**: Per-trade maximum amounts

### Delisting Detection
- **Automatic Detection**: Identifies delisted tokens after 5 consecutive price fetch failures
- **Loss Tracking**: Records 100% loss for delisted tokens
- **Telegram Alerts**: Immediate notification when tokens are delisted
- **Position Cleanup**: Removes delisted tokens from active monitoring
- **Trade Logging**: Logs delisted trades with reason code

### Pre-Buy Delisting Check
- **Pre-Purchase Validation**: Checks if tokens are delisted before buying
- **Chain-Specific Logic**: Different validation rules for Ethereum vs Solana tokens
- **Conservative Approach**: Skips tokens that can't be verified
- **DexScreener Protection**: Prevents buying tokens with stale/inactive data
- **Configurable**: Can be enabled/disabled via `enable_pre_buy_delisting_check`
- **Dependency Validation**: Enhanced error handling for missing Solana dependencies
- **Graceful Degradation**: Provides clear error messages and installation instructions when dependencies are missing

### Position Monitoring
- **Real-time Tracking**: Monitors all positions every 30 seconds
- **Automatic Sell Triggers**: Take profit, stop loss, and trailing stop
- **Multi-chain Price Fetching**: Chain-specific price monitoring
- **PnL Calculation**: Real-time profit/loss tracking
- **Telegram Integration**: Instant notifications for all events

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### 🔐 Secrets Management
1. **Use secure secrets backends** - AWS Secrets Manager, encrypted local files, or environment variables
2. **Never store private keys in plain text** - Avoid `.env` files for production
3. **Rotate credentials regularly** - Update private keys and API tokens periodically
4. **Use dedicated trading wallets** - Separate from main wallets
5. **Limit wallet permissions** - Only grant necessary permissions

### 🛡️ Trading Security
6. **Start with small amounts** - Test with minimal funds first
7. **Monitor the bot regularly** - Check for unusual activity
8. **Set appropriate wallet balance buffers** - Configure `min_wallet_balance_buffer` to reserve funds for gas
9. **Monitor position concentration** - The bot prevents duplicate buys, but monitor overall portfolio diversity
10. **Understand delisting risks** - Meme tokens can be delisted quickly, resulting in 100% loss
11. **Monitor position alerts** - Pay attention to Telegram notifications for position updates

### 🔧 Infrastructure Security
12. **Regularly update dependencies** - Keep all packages updated
13. **Test on testnets first** - Validate functionality before mainnet
14. **Use hardware wallets for large amounts** - Consider hardware wallets for significant funds
15. **Secure wallet setup** - Use separate wallets for different networks (MetaMask for ETH/Base, Phantom for Solana)
16. **Backup secrets securely** - Store backup credentials in secure locations
17. **Monitor access logs** - Track who has access to your secrets

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Solana Import Errors
**Error**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'solana.keypair'`

**Solution**: Install the correct Solana version:
```bash
pip uninstall solana -y
pip install solana==0.27.0
```

**Why**: Newer versions of the Solana package (0.30+) removed the `keypair` module, which is required for the bot's pre-buy delisting checks.

#### 2. Delisted Token Still Bought
**Issue**: Token appears "delisted" in logs but gets bought anyway

**Explanation**: 
- "Delisted" messages in discovery logs indicate tokens with zero liquidity, not actual delisting
- If pre-buy delisting check fails due to missing dependencies, the bot defaults to allowing the trade
- Check if Solana dependencies are properly installed

**Solution**: Ensure Solana dependencies are correct and pre-buy checks are working

#### 3. Pre-Buy Delisting Check Failures
**Error**: `⚠️ Pre-buy check failed for [TOKEN]: No module named 'solana.keypair'`

**Solution**: Fix Solana dependencies as shown above

**Impact**: Without proper delisting checks, the bot may buy tokens that are actually delisted or inactive

#### 4. SSL Warnings
**Warning**: `NotOpenSSLWarning: urllib3 v2 only supports OpenSSL 1.1.1+`

**Solution**: This is a warning and doesn't affect functionality. For production, consider updating OpenSSL or using a different Python environment.

#### 5. Secrets Management Issues
**Error**: `❌ Missing required secrets`

**Solution**: 
```bash
# Set up secrets interactively
python setup_secrets.py

# Or migrate from existing .env
python setup_secrets.py migrate
```

**Error**: `❌ Error accessing AWS Secrets Manager`

**Solution**: 
- Ensure AWS CLI is configured: `aws configure`
- Check IAM permissions for Secrets Manager
- Verify AWS region matches your configuration

**Error**: `⚠️ Encryption not available for local secrets`

**Solution**: Install cryptography package:
```bash
pip install cryptography
```

### Dependency Issues

#### Solana Package Version Conflicts
The bot requires specific Solana package versions:
- ✅ `solana==0.27.0` (includes `keypair` module)
- ❌ `solana>=0.30.0` (missing `keypair` module)

#### Installation Verification
Test Solana dependencies:
```bash
python -c "import solana.keypair; print('✅ Solana keypair module working')"
```

### Performance Issues

#### High Gas Fees
- Use Base network for lower fees
- Adjust `min_wallet_balance_buffer` to ensure sufficient gas
- Monitor gas prices before trading

#### Slow Token Discovery
- Check RPC endpoint connectivity
- Verify API rate limits
- Consider using paid RPC providers for production
